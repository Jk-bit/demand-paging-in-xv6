1. added raw_elf_size in struct proc
2. changed the exec code
    - the text and data section will be loaded from the filesystemonlu
    - the stack is written with the command line arguments and stored into the backing store
    - Heap structure not yet implemented but will be done.

Basic Problem Solving :
    - There is array of size BACK_STORE_SIZE which shows whether the block is free or not if it is free it contains the value -1, otherwise it contaons the virtual address  of the main memory address it is mapped to.
    - Every proc(in the struct proc) contains the linked list of the block that is allocated to it.
    - Whwn there is page fault we will go through the linked list check in the array the virtual address if it maps the virtual addr that made the page fault, page in the frame.
